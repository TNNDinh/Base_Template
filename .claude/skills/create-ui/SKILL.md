description: Build, extend, and refactor Unity UI with the shared template prefabs under `Assets/_Project/Visual/ArtAsset/Shared/Resources/Prefabs/Templates`. Use when Codex needs to create a new feature screen or popup that inherits from `FeatureBaseController`, create a prefab variant from `Popup_Template/screen_template`, or assemble reusable UI blocks such as tabs, lists, sliders, input fields, item or currency previews, resource headers, text boxes, and trigger cards through Unity MCP.

# Create UI

## Overview

Use this skill to choose an existing shared prefab template, instantiate it with Unity MCP, and preserve the prefab's built-in layout groups, controllers, and serialized references.

Read [references/prefab-templates.md](references/prefab-templates.md) before editing when the request depends on choosing a template or understanding a prefab's hierarchy and runtime behavior.

For the **executable layer** — exact Unity MCP tool sequence, property paths (`m_*`), value formats, reference wiring, the screenshot verify loop, and screen registration — follow [references/mcp-playbook.md](references/mcp-playbook.md). This skill decides *what* to build; the playbook is the deterministic *how*. Do not improvise MCP commands when the playbook covers the operation.

## Workflow

1. Decide whether the request is for a root feature screen or a reusable child prefab.
2. If the root object should inherit from `FeatureBaseController`, start from `Popup_Template/screen_template` as a prefab variant.
3. If the request is only for a reusable block inside a screen, choose the closest prefab from `Templates/Templates`.
4. Assemble the UI by reusing existing prefabs before creating raw GameObjects, following the MCP tool loop in [references/mcp-playbook.md](references/mcp-playbook.md) §1.
5. Change only the safe surfaces first: text, icon sprites, anchored position, size delta, spacing, padding, colors, child activation, and serialized lists intended for configuration. Use the exact `m_*` property paths and value formats in the playbook §3.
6. Wire serialized references (close buttons, `MainUI`, tab toggles) per playbook §4 — a screen renders but stays non-functional until references are wired.
7. **Screenshot and self-correct** (`unity_screenshot_game`) after each meaningful chunk — playbook §5. Do not declare the UI done without looking at it; building blind is the main failure mode.
8. Validate the result in hierarchy terms: correct parent, correct anchors, no broken references, dynamic children placed in the intended container, and root feature fields still consistent with `FeatureBaseController` (runnable checks in playbook §9).

## Feature Screen Workflow

Apply this workflow when the new root prefab is a feature screen or popup and the controller inherits from `FeatureBaseController`.

1. Create or reuse the feature folder under `Assets/_Project/Features/<Category>/<FeatureName>/` (`<Category>` is one of `Meta`, `Social`, `System`, `Monetization`, `Events`, `Gameplay`, `Onboarding`).
2. Put the screen prefab in `Assets/_Project/Features/<Category>/<FeatureName>/Resources/`.
3. Create a prefab variant from `Assets/_Project/Visual/ArtAsset/Shared/Resources/Prefabs/Templates/Popup_Template/screen_template.prefab`. `unity_asset_create_prefab` **does** produce a true variant as long as the source is an instantiated `screen_template` instance (verified) — see playbook §8. Do not build from a blank GameObject, or you get a detached regular prefab.
4. Name the prefab consistently with the feature. In this repo, common screen names are `screen_<snake_case>.prefab`, but follow the existing naming already used by that feature folder when present.
5. **Add the feature's `FeatureBaseController` subclass to the root** — `screen_template` ships with NO controller component (verified: root has only `Canvas`/`CanvasScaler`/`GraphicRaycaster`/`UITransition`/`CanvasGroup`). The controller must be created and attached.
6. Keep the root structure compatible with `FeatureBaseController`: child `[0] = background_button` (Image + optional Button), child `[1] = popup_template` (MainUI). Build the screen body under `popup_template/popup_container/container_content`.
7. Build the content of the screen by reusing child templates from `Templates/Templates` and other existing prefabs already used by nearby features.
8. **Register the screen** so `UIManager.Show()` can open it (playbook §7): add a `GameEnums.Features` entry, name the prefab `screen_<snake_case>` matching the enum via `ToSnakeCase`, and attach the controller. `UIManager.Show()` loads `screen_{feature.ToSnakeCase()}` from any `Resources/` folder.
9. Reopen the prefab and verify controller references, close buttons, and transition behavior; then verify it actually opens via `UIManager.Show(...)` (play-mode + screenshot) before considering the work done.
10. If any `.cs` file was created or edited (the controller), run `/compile-check` before reporting done.

## FeatureBaseController Rules

- `FeatureBaseController` expects the root object to carry the screen controller component.
- If `MainUI` is left null, `FeatureBaseController` falls back to `transform.GetChild(1)`.
- `FeatureBaseController` also reads the background image from `transform.GetChild(0)`.
- Because of that fallback, do not reorder the first children of the root variant casually.
- If the root child order changes, explicitly set `MainUI` and verify background access still points to the intended overlay object.
- Preserve `UITransition`, `Canvas`, `CanvasGroup`, and other base screen infrastructure that already exists on `screen_template`.
- Review `FeatureType`, `ClickBackgroundToExit`, `_closeButtons`, `_backgroundAlpha`, and time-scale flags on every new feature screen.

## Template Selection

- Use `FrameTemplate` for a plain framed panel background.
- Use `textbox_template` for a framed text surface with built-in content text.
- Use `InputField01_Basic_White_NormalText` for editable text entry.
- Use `ScrollViewTemplate` for any scrollable container. Add dynamic content under `Viewport/Content`, not under the root.
- Use `SliderTemplate` for a read-only progress or fill bar. It ships as a non-interactable slider with fill only.
- Use `tab_template` as the tab-strip container and `toggle_tab_template` as the tab button unit.
- Use `CurrencyPreview` for one currency row and `CurrenciesPreview` for a runtime-generated row of multiple currencies.
- Use `ItemElement` for one item or reward cell and `ItemPreview` for a runtime-generated strip of multiple item cells.
- Use `ItemElementRewardPopup` when the visual should feel like a reward popup, not an inventory tile.
- Use `ResourceViewer` for a live resource header chip with icon, value, and add button.
- Use `TriggerTemplate` as a source gallery of trigger-card variants. Duplicate a single child variant instead of dropping the whole gallery into production UI.

## Guardrails

- Do not create a new feature screen by plain file duplication when the root should stay linked to `screen_template`. Use a prefab variant.
- Do not use `screen_template` as a child widget. It is for root feature screens only.
- Do not remove `CurrencyPreviewController`, `ItemPreviewController`, `ItemElementController`, `ResourceItemViewController`, `UI_TabExtensions`, `UI_ButtonExtensions`, or `ShowingObjectController` unless the user explicitly wants a behavior rewrite.
- Do not remove `FeatureBaseController` or `UITransition` from root feature screens unless the user explicitly wants to replace the screen lifecycle.
- Do not replace a prefab with raw primitives when a matching shared template already exists.
- Do not move dynamic content to the wrong level. Example: keep scroll items under `ScrollViewTemplate/Viewport/Content`.
- Do not clear serialized references on controller components. Most of these prefabs depend on inspector wiring.
- Preserve nested prefab instances and override only what the task needs.
- Preserve unknown or third-party components on `TriggerTemplate` variants. They include animation and display behavior that is easy to break by stripping components.

## Unity MCP Notes

- For the full command sequence, property paths, value formats, and the screenshot verify loop, follow [references/mcp-playbook.md](references/mcp-playbook.md). The notes below are high-level reminders only.
- Prefer instantiating by the `Resources` path `Prefabs/Templates/Templates/<PrefabName>`.
- For feature-screen roots, use the template at `Prefabs/Templates/Popup_Template/screen_template`.
- After instantiation, rename the instance for scene clarity only if it does not break code that relies on child-name lookup.
- When wiring tabs, update both the toggle children and the `UI_TabExtensions` serialized lists so the selected toggle and target content panels stay in sync.
- When wiring list-style prefabs, keep the template child reference intact and let the controller spawn the runtime children.
- When the request is mostly visual, duplicate the closest prefab and override styling instead of composing a new structure from zero.
- Validate against nearby feature folders in the current repo before inventing a new folder or naming pattern.
